# **Kubernetes Mastery Roadmap for Enterprise-Grade Expertise**

**Objective:**
To acquire in-depth knowledge and practical expertise in Kubernetes, enabling the design, deployment, scaling, and troubleshooting of highly available, secure, and performance-optimized clusters across on-premises and cloud environments. This program covers self-managed Kubernetes and managed Kubernetes services such as Amazon EKS, with a focus on production-grade practices, compliance, and integration with CI/CD pipelines.

* Configure High Availability for control plane components.
* Backup and restore etcd in disaster recovery scenarios.

**Scenario Simulation:**

* Perform controlled node drains and pod rescheduling.
* Execute etcd backup and validate restoration.

---

### **Week 8: Resource Governance and Policy Enforcement**

* Implement PodDisruptionBudgets and ResourceQuotas.
* Optimize cluster autoscaler for cost efficiency.
* Apply Pod Security Standards for compliance.

**Hands-On Task:**

* Configure namespace-specific resource limits.
* Enforce security context constraints on workloads.

---

## **Phase 3: Enterprise Architecture and Cloud-Native Integration (Day 61–90)**

**Objective:** Transition from cluster operations to architecture design and managed Kubernetes services.

### **Week 9: Managed Kubernetes with Amazon EKS**

* Understand EKS control plane design and AWS-managed components.
* Configure IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) for secure integrations.
* Deploy node groups and Fargate profiles.

**Hands-On:**

* Provision EKS cluster using `eksctl` and AWS CLI.
* Deploy workloads with IAM-integrated service accounts.

---

### **Week 10: Cloud-Native Storage, Networking, and Scaling**

* Configure AWS ALB Ingress Controller for EKS.
* Integrate EBS/EFS storage for persistent workloads.
* Implement Cluster Autoscaler and Karpenter for advanced scaling.

**Practical Scenario:**

* Deploy a multi-tier application with ALB Ingress and auto-scaling policies.
* Implement CloudWatch Container Insights for advanced observability.

---

### **Week 11: Kubernetes CI/CD and GitOps Integration**

* Build GitOps pipelines with ArgoCD or Flux.
* Deploy workloads via Helm Charts and Kustomize.
* Integrate Jenkins or GitHub Actions with Kubernetes deployments.
